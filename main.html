	<h1>Time Complexity</h1>
	<p>
	Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It characterizes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input to the algorithm.
	</p>
	<h1>Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
	<b>Space complexity</b> the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of memory it requires in relation to the size of the input to the algorithm.Similar to time complexity, space complexity is often expressed using big O notation, denoted as O(f(n)), where "f(n)" is a mathematical function representing the growth rate of the space required by the algorithm concerning the input size "n."
