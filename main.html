	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm
        and how the running time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. An algorithm with efficient
        time complexity means it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity is another essential aspect of algorithm analysis. It quantifies the amount of memory
        an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. In space complexity analysis, we often use Big O notation,
        such as O(n), to describe the growth rate of the space required by an algorithm. <b>Space Complexity</b>
        provides insights into how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources.
